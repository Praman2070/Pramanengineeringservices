        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Point cloud data, a type of 3D surface representation, is often created via airborne or terrestrial laser scanning, also known as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The data is generated as sets of high density (e.g. x, y, z) points or in a more common binary format known as LAS, which can include various return values and point intensities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Many top GIS processing software tools now enable and accommodate basic and sophisticated LiDAR data processing and analysis. LIDAR is developing as one of the most cost-effective and precise data collection methods for managing major assets like railway stations and other public/private infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          We do accurate fast surveys over huge geographical regions and transmit results promptly. Airborne LiDAR surveys and aerial laser scanning surveys are carried out by our specialists. We also have an in-house data processing team with years of expertise. We provide a variety of LiDAR systems for conducting wide-area surveys in mines, forests, and cities.
